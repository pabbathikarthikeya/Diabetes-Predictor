Diabetes Predictor

Overview

The Diabetes Predictor project is a web-based application developed using Flask, HTML, and CSS. It utilizes a machine learning model based on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes. Users can input various health metrics such as pregnancies, glucose levels, insulin levels, BMI, blood pressure, and weight via the user-friendly interface. The application runs on Anaconda Prompt, providing a seamless experience for users to assess their diabetes risk conveniently.


Features:

Input various health metrics.
Predict the likelihood of having diabetes.
User-friendly interface.

Working of Model:

This model will use the KNN algorithm to classify new data points based on their proximity to existing data points in the feature space. Adjusting the n_neighbors parameter can affect the model's performance, as it determines how many neighbors will contribute to the classification decision. Similarly, changing the metric parameter can alter the distance calculation method used by the algorithm.
